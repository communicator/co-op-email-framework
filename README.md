<h3>Getting Started...</h3>
<p>Email today is viewed in a myriad of different ways, from different email clients, to different browsers to different devices and then on to different environments. The experience you provide to your recipient can draw customers in or drive them away, but it can be difficult to ensure they receive the best experience for the device they’re using at the time they want to view your message.</p>

<p>While many web sites are now optimised for the device they are being viewed on email messages still lag behind, with many companies not yet using Responsive Email Design throughout their email campaigns. However, best-in-class companies are improving their conversion rates by delivering immersive email experiences including dynamic design elements that are tailored to recipients' needs and their viewing device.</p>

<p>This best practices design guide will discuss our recommendations based on our work with best-in-class companies that have transformed their recipients’ email experience using Responsive Email Design to strengthen customer relationships from the email inbox which ever device they are viewing the email on. This guide can help you optimise your email campaigns with Responsive Email Design to deliver truly immersive email experiences with recipient focused implementations. This will help you serve your recipients’ needs and preferences and strengthen customer relationships.</p>

<p>This best-practices guide is based on work with numerous desktop, mobile and tablet implementations utilising Communicator. As we’re sure you are aware, mobile devices and their capabilities are forever changing and likewise so are the techniques used to make sure that emails render correctly on the range of available email clients.</p>
