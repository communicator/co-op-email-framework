The Co-operative Group - Email Framework
=====================

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Email today is viewed in a myriad of different ways, from different email clients, to different browsers to different devices and then on to different environments. The experience you provided to the recipient can draw customers in or drive them away, but it can be difficult to ensure they receive the best experience for the device they’re using at the time they want to view your message.</p>

<p>While many websites are now optimised for the device they are being viewed on, email messages still lag behind, with many companies not yet using Responsive Email Design throughout their email campaigns. However, best-in-class companies are improving their conversion rates by delivering immersive email experiences including dynamic design elements that are tailored to recipients' needs and their viewing device.</p>

<p>These template frameworks are intended to be used by The Co-operative Group's roster of agencies to help transform the end recipients’ email experience as well as strengthen overall customer relationships from the email inbox from which ever device they are viewing the email on.</p>

<p>These templates are based on work with numerous desktop, mobile and tablet implementations utilising Communicator. As we’re sure you are aware, mobile devices and their capabilities are forever changing and likewise so are the techniques used to make sure that emails render correctly on the range of available email clients.</p>

<h3>Adaptive or Fluid?</h3>

<p>Those of you who are already well versed in email design will know already that because of the lack of any email standards, getting an email to render pixel perfect across every single device is nearly impossible, and the same goes for making emails mobile friendly.</p>

<p>Because of this we have chosen to make 2 versions of the templates available; one which relies on media queries (adaptive), and one which doesn't (fluid).</p>

<p>Which one you choose to work with depends on the need of the business. Although the fluid template may look the stronger of the two, because it is it built on percentages, the pixel perfect </p>

<p><strong>Adaptive</strong></p>

<p>The adaptive template relies on media queries to force table columns into rows and shrinks images, all while maintaining the layout's spacing, padding, and alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid</strong></p>

<p>The fluid template relies on one layout that looks good on all screen sizes. Good for when media queries aren't available to detect device size and reconfigure the layout.</p>

<h3>The Future?</h3>

<p>Up until early 2014</p>
